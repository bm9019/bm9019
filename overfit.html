Demonstration of Over-fitting in Regression
</h2>
</center>
</div>
</html>
<p>Over-fitting a model means that the fit of the model would not apply
well to other data sets and that’s pretty much the whole point of
actually fitting the model in the first place. When there’s a lot of
variables being tested and with less sample size there is more potential
to find statistical significance that may not be applicable to other
data. R<sup>2</sup> is typically used for model fit for a regression but
there are methods to alter the R<sup>2</sup> to try and correct for any
over-fitting that may be occurring. <a
href="https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/multiple-regession-analysis-use-adjusted-r-squared-and-predicted-r-squared-to-include-the-correct-number-of-variables#:~:text=The%20adjusted%20R%2Dsquared%20is,less%20than%20expected%20by%20chance.">Adjusted
R<sup>2</sup></a> uses a mathematical formula based on sample size and
number of variables to adjust R<sup>2</sup> downward to its true
estimation. There are also methods that involve iterating through the
sample while leaving some of the data out to get an average
R<sup>2</sup>. This <a
href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-estimate-model-accuracy-in-r-using-the-caret-package/">site</a>
gives a good overview of methods like that such as k-folds and
leave-one-out cross validation.</p>
<p>Uncorrelated data was simulated to test how R, R<sup>2</sup>, and R
estimated using leave-one-out, K-Fold, and repeated K-Folds cross
validation performed. The simulation code is shown below.</p>

<p>You would think that plain old R-Square would be the highest (and
thus more over-estimating) value in all instances and while that happens
in most instances, when there is a low number of variables K-fold and
repeated K-fold is actually as high or higher. In all k-folds there were
10 folds so it could be that the fold numbers were not adequate for
those sample and variable sizes. Leave-one-out tends to do a good job of
not overestimating model fit and so does adjusted R-Square. Future
analysis may look at how these measures deal with correlated
variables.</p>
